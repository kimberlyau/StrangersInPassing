    <p> This project will serve as an online journal for my random encounters during my travels. </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I've been meaning to do this for a while, but I haven't had the time or motivation.
      </li>
      <li>
        There's a lot of cool people I've met that I'd like to remember
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What's with the title?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Have you heard of that one black and white movie
        <a id="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044079/">Strangers on a Train</a>?
      </li>

        </td>
        <td>
          Although Amtrak offers more convenient locations, Metrolink can prove to cost less
          if you are making a day trip on the weekends as it offers a $10 day pass.

          Oftentimes university students have rideshare pages where students give each other rides. Generally safe as most pages are closed to only students of a particular university.
